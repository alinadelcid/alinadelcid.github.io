        <h1 class="body-h1">Redesigning the Fire Museum of Maryland</h1>    
        <p>The Fire Museum of Maryland is a non-profit institution located in Lutherville, Maryland. Originally founded in 1971, it is now home to a world-class collection of historic hand engines and fire apparatus. To help grab the attention of the museum’s target audience, younger children as well as older adults, a redesigned identity was created to capture the essence of the museum. <mark>They sought a rebrand that honored their mission: To educate the public on the history, technology, and innovation of the U.S. fire service.</mark></p>

        <h1 class="body-h1">Starting off with a site visit</h1> 
        <p>

        I began this project by gaining a clear understanding of the museum's mission, purpose, and target audience by conducting visitor and staff interviews on site. Additionally, I conducted a competitive audit to analyze what has been successful and unsuccessful for similar institutions. </p>

        <p>The main insight was that the museum's current branding lacked focus on the collections that attracted visitors the most: Their firetrucks. It also lacked visual appeal for target audiences. With issues in legibility, color contrast, and visual hierarchy, it was difficult for both older audiences and children to engage.</p>

        <p>Logo sketches were directly inspired by the museum's mission to educate the public on fire service history, along with putting greater emphasis on their firetruck collections. The goal was to rebrand the museum's identity in an honorable, accessible, and visually appealing way.</p>

        <h1 class="body-h1">The final logo</h1> 
        <p>After producing multiple digital variations, the final logo emerged. The logo brings together ideas of an honorable institution with emphasis on their famous collections by illustrating a historic firetruck in the foreground and a golden badge in the background. The badge helps convey the sense of safety and honor that is often associated with fire departments.<mark>The visualization of the firetruck was inspired by a real vehicle in the museum, specifically the 1957 Seagrave “Anniversary Series” Pumping Engine.</mark> </p>
