        <h1 class="body-h1">An app to help combat those moments of self-doubt</h1>    
            <p>Having dealt with repetitive doubts about my future and career, imposter syndrome has played a huge role in my life. <mark>Imposter syndrome is a behavioral health phenomenon described as self-doubt of intellect, skills, or accomplishments common among high-achieving individuals</mark> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK585058/" target="_blank">National Library of Medicine</a>). This motivated me to create a product that could help high-achievers (within school, professional, and work settings) improve their personal outlooks.</p>

        <h4 class="body-label">PROBLEM</h4>
        <h1 class="body-h1">No matter the achievements, successful people still doubt themselves</h1>    
        <p>Despite working hard and accomplishing great things for their personal and professional goals, high-achievers still experience moments of self-doubt. This led me to my main question: <mark>How might I help these high-achievers combat the negative thoughts they have of themselves?</mark></p>

        <h1 class="body-h1">Revival: An app that uses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) concepts to help users develop more rational, healthier thought patterns in response to self-doubt.</h1>

        <h4 class="body-label">RESEARCH</h4>
        <h1 class="body-h1">Getting to know more about the problem</h1>    
        <p>I started off my research by getting a full understanding of what imposter syndrome was. I then explored its current solutions with an aim to integrate different ideas into the product interface. <mark>Solutions I repeatedly found:</mark> recalling your achievements, separating feelings from facts, stop comparing yourself, and cognitive behavioral therapy (the practice of reframing negative thoughts).<br class="body-br"> <br class="body-br">
        With further analyzing, I noticed that all these suggestions were framed inside the same concept: <mark>In order to combat imposter syndrome, new positive behaviors and thought processes need to be adapted. This is where I decided that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) would be the best focus to design around.</mark> It also essentially encapsulates all the other solutions into one single idea.

        <h4 class="body-label">COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
        <h1 class="body-h1">The competition was pricey and lacked focus on CBT and imposter syndrome</h1>    
        <p>I analyzed 4 digital resources available for those dealing with imposter syndrome. I found that <mark>there was a huge lack of openly accessible resources</mark> (most were paid for full access) and <mark>many did not have an in-depth focus on imposter syndrome or CBT.</mark> This then became my opportunity for the solution.

        <h1 class="body-h1">All interviewees have experienced imposter syndrome at least once</h1>    
        <p>To get a better understanding of my target users (high-achieving individuals), I conducted interviews with 3 college students, 2 working professionals, and 1 store employee. I asked them the questions below to find trends on how they've managed imposter syndrome then organized my data through affinity mapping.

        <p><mark>I learned:</mark> How important thorough research is for empathizing with your target audience. This project was challenging due to the amount of phycological/scientific research I had to do. Despite the challenge, I found that the more I knew, the more I could understand the hardships and emotions that my target audience was going through.<br class="body-br"><br class="body-br">

            <mark>I improved:</mark> My visual design skills for creating a user-friendly experience that meets web content accessibility standards. This project allowed me to learn about web color contrast ratios and other visual guidelines for accessibility. <br class="body-br"><br class="body-br">

            <mark>Future steps:</mark> I would love to have quantitative data to measure the impact and value of my product. What is the conversion rate? How satisfied are my users? How does my product meet business-oriented goals? Knowing this would allow for further iteration.
